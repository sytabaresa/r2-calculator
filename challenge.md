# Take-Home Project


Project Description: You will build a clone of the native iOS calculator application using web technologies. R2 uses React but please use the technologies that are most familiar to you.

Features:
A field for displaying the current value being inputted and the results of an evaluation.
Buttons to input different single-digit numbers.
Buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
A button to evaluate the inputs.
The ability to chain the previous evaluated value into another equation.
If I press `2` `+` `2` `=`  the output should be 4 If I then press `+` `2` `=`  I should get 6.

This is as much an exercise in your ability to break a medium-sized project down into small bite-sized pieces as an engineering exercise. Once you’ve completed the assignment, please share the repo prior to the conversation.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.



## During the technical interview

Please be ready to talk through your approach as well as extend your app while we pair program during the technical interview. 

If you’re unable to complete the take-home project in under 2-3 hours, don’t worry we can complete it during the interview.  We’d much rather you bring a well-thought-out but incomplete project, than something feature complete but fragile.

Some examples of features we might add during the technical interview.
Ability to handle negative numbers.
An operator to square the input.
Ability to handle decimal numbers.
Change the background color of the calculator based upon the most recent evaluation output.
